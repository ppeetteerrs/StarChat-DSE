        "content": "Good evening everyone, today we’re going to talk about whether study time should be introduced in Hong Kong. Why don’t we start by talking about the benefits of having study time in Hong Kong? I believe the … one of the main benefits that the study time provide is that … it can increase the study time of the kids nowadays, and so that they can have a better results in their academics because they are required to study at home or … at other places like common place or community hall which they are forced to study in that period of time. I believe this can effectively enhance their academic results and so that they can be more hardworking and disciplined and more focused on their academics. Er, do you have anything to add in?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A",
        "content": "I think you have raised a … a valid point. Erm, the point you have raised is a general benefit of having study time. But particularly in Hong Kong, I think … the benefit … one of the benefits of having study time in Hong Kong is to provide a more balanced lifestyle for Hong Kong teenagers nowadays because Hong Kong has been long criticised on placing too much emphasis on academics, so the Hong Kong kids seldom have time to play. Erm, having study time means that the kids are …… only have to study during the fixed time period. So, they can have a more balanced lifestyle after having the study time. So, do you have any other ideas?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "B",
        "content": "Apart from having a more balanced lifestyle, I think it’s also … can motivate the students to … study together and having a greater incentive to study more focusedly, erm, as they may be encouraged by other industrious students. Erm, on the other hand, I think that the older students may also help the younger ones because not only can they share the academics knowledge but they also share some life experience such as, erm, hobbies or interests, etc."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "D",
        "content": "I think you’ve raised a very good point about … this study time having … its use of teaching students the importance of studying alone, as … after lessons, they may … there may not be the presence of teachers. So, … with only their books and their friends, they may try to … learn from each other, understand and … really … get into the books and understand what they’ve learned in the lessons, and make sure they, they get what the teachers mean, which is … what studying is good for."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A",
        "content": "So, why don’t we move on to the negative effects of having study time? Erm, in my opinion, … having study time will make … students lose interest in studying because as mentioned in the article, … having study time means that the children … are forced to study during the fixed time period, so that the students may think that they are forced to do something and they may lose interest in studying, … which makes studying ineffective. So, do you have any other… do you, do you have any other opinion on the negative effects?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "C",
        "content": "I share the same view with you that … students will feel bad about this scheme as they are forced to study. And besides, I think they will also be tired … after, after a long day of studying in school and having many other activities. And they will be tired if they are forced to study in that fixed period of time at night every day. And I think this will cause … harmful effect on their psychological … health, which, it is a negative effect too. Do you have any other opinions?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "B",
        "content": "Yah, because nowadays, the students in Hong Kong are having too much EC … extracurricular activities. And this will add much pressures on them if they have the EC … if they have the study time after the … after school. So, I think it will have some negative effects on their psychological developments."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "D",
        "content": "I believe apart from the psychological effects it may have on the children, I think … another problem this may … cause, of having a study time, is … is that the learning pace, learning speed may be different among different school children. Some may take shorter time. Some may only need one hour or half an hour each day to do their studying and get good results. And by forcing them maybe for … studying for two hours, may have …… negative adverse effects which may not … directly increase the results … as their … learning pace may be different."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "C",
        "content": "Well, I … agree with you that their learning pace is different. And talking about this, I also believe that it is one of the reasons that, why study time may not be feasible to be implemented in Hong Kong, as everyone is different in terms of their learning pace or …… their preference of studying. It is not really feasible because students nowadays, they have many extracurricular activities. They may not be able to free out the time at night to study at that fixed period of time. And also, they have many tutorials nowadays which … have the same, similar effects … with the study time. So, I think it may not be … so feasible to be implemented in Hong Kong. Do you think so?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A",
        "content": "Before moving on to whether study time could be … feasible to implemented, I would like to add one more point to the negative effects. Erm, as mentioned in the article, when the children are not studying, they have to pay a fine, which is a really heavy amount for some families. I think this act may … make the children lose interest because by paying a fine, … they think they are … pressurised to do something they are not willing to. And they will think that studying is some, is a penalty, so they will lose interest and this is one of the negative effects."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "B",
        "content": "Hmm, I think adding some financial pressure is … another negative effects of having study time. And, perhaps we can now move on to whether study time could be implemented in Hong Kong. And, erm, in my opinion, … it should be compulsory … in Hong Kong because … poor students could, poor students and underprivileged students can have a chance to be tutored by some …… volunteers. Cuz, … nowadays, the tutor fees are quite expensive, so they may not be … they may not affordable for … may not be able to afford the … tutor fees. So, if the government could implement the study time, the … the children can have a chance to be tutored as well."

      {
        "speaker": "D",
        "content": "Erm, I think the intentions of study time is … good and should be encouraged in Hong Kong. But, … the reality in Hong Kong is that … there are all full time schools with lots of homework provided for the students. If … maybe a two-hour study time is assigned, is … is made compulsory for every, every school child in Hong Kong, it may cause … maybe … large pressure to the children, which could be opposed by many parents … nowadays in Hong Kong society. That’s why with … with the possible opposition by Hong Kong parents, this … policy, this, this plan of study time may not be … possible to be implemented in Hong Kong."

        "content": "Although many people would like to study after school or in the evening, my favorite time to study is in the morning because I believe in the morning, … our brains function … the best because … we have gained a lot of sleep and energy after a whole night of sleeping, so we can have … more energy and a clear mind to study. Erm, it is also mentioned by some newspaper articles that … studying in the morning will help you to memorise things more effectively. Erm, and this is why I would like to study in the morning, … for example, at 5 am or 6 am after I woke up in the morning. Erm, on the other hand, I guess studying after school is very tiring and this may not be effective. Thank you."

And when I saw them, they are hardworking, and I will also be get … I will also be encouraged to study more focusedly. And also when I have pop up with some questions and get some … get into some difficulties about … what I’m studying, I could ask my peers and my study buddies about those inquiries and get rid of them immediately. If I’m studying alone at home, I have to … take a photo of that question or ask … and get the answer …… like after 15 minutes at least. So, I think, to be more effective, I’d like to study with a group of students."

        "speaker": "C",
        "content": "First of all, I do not think a fine can be a motivation for students to study. But, … besides this, I believe that … some awards or rewards that given to the students can motivate them to study more hardworking and also … be motivated to study in this scheme. For example, if they behave well in the study time and really study hard and focus on their study, they can be awarded some gifts, for example, books or some books coupons for them to purchase books and to further … increase their interest in studying. And I think this can effectively enhance their interest in studying and they will be more positively encouraged to study instead of having pressure to study in that study scheme. Erm, so I believe that by … rewarding them some gifts would … effectively … motivate them to study. Thank you."

First of all, I think study time is used for … encouraging and perhaps maybe, forcing students who do not have enough study time to have study time … to open their books and to learn to understand what they’ve learned in the lesson. Er, this is very, very important for students with weaker abilities as first of all, … they may not have … the right motivations to …  to study alone or to even to study with … other classmates because they may think … as … my mark is already so … quite low, maybe … studying is … not a especially good thing to do. Er, by forcing them to study, by giving them a reason to study, … it gives them a chance for them to excel in what they are not … exactly performing too well in."
