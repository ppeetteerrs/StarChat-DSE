        "content": "Good afternoon, fellows. I think all of you are already aware of the topic that we will discuss today. Let's ... let's exchange our views on the traditional ... on the traditions of giving mooncakes. First, I ... I really think, I really agree with that traditions of giving mooncakes to friends and relatives is wasteful. Er, as we can see from the article that China produced over ... 250,000 tons of mooncakes every year. Erm, that is a lot, right? And I can't imagine that mooncakes become our breakfast, our lunch and dinner in order to clear all the mooncakes given by the relatives."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "B",
        "content": "Yeah, ... I get your point. Erm, not only the amount of the ... package of the mooncakes, but also the material of those package. Erm, as we know, those wrapping papers and ... iron boxes and plastic bags are non- ... recyclable. So, it will be a lot of ... it will provide a lot of ... waste to the ... natural habitat. And also, people cannot eat all of the mooncakes which they received from others or they bought from the ... market. So, it will also produce a huge food waste."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "C",
        "content": "Yes, ... I agree with you. Er, I think ... the most important is not the material we make. The most ... important is that ... when we make it out, and then we don't ... touch them and ... remain, just remain in our home. So, I think this food be a ... wasteful action. So, ...... so I think ... so, giving ... mooncake is a wasteful ... action ... in ... Mid-Autumn Festival."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "B",
        "content": "Yeah ... thank you for your opinions. And so, let's move on to the next topic. Erm, I think ... traditional mooncake ... should be replaced with non-traditional versions. So, basically, I think traditional versions focused on ... luxury feelings. There're, or a lot of ... incredible things but actually not really useful, or not really necessary. Erm, so ... although the ... it will be really ... suitable for the Mid-Autumn Festival's ... atmosphere, ... it is not really ... environmental friendly. And oppositely, non-traditional versions ... are as welly designed for adapting the festival and eco-friendly. "
      },
      {
        "speaker": "A",
        "content": "Yes, ... non-traditional versions of mooncakes ... become very popular recently. Er, because ... the ... ingredient ... is different ... maybe there're some ... durian, some strawberry inside the mooncake ... it's ... And I think whether it should be replaced ... I think let, let it happen neutrally ... it's okay because some people, like teens, like non-traditional one, but some ... older generation like the traditional one. So, it's different people like different things. So, it is very difficult for us to said a sentence strictly that non-traditional ... non-traditional mooncakes should be replaced with non-traditional one."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "C",
        "content": "Yes, I also agree with you ... because ... traditional mooncake, ... it contain ... excessive ... packaging and the most important is high calorie. Er, it will ... make us ... if, if we ... eat too much, it will make ... make us ... be overweight. So, I think ... non-traditional version can be ... using ... can use less ... packaging and ... or ... using others material to ... replace, to, to replace traditional material ... using some ... healthy ... material ... to non-traditional version. I think ... it would, it would be better ...  compared with ... traditional mooncake. So, it should be replaced. Yes, and ... and now ... we can ... move on to talk about ... if ... if we don't, if we don't ... give mooncakes in Mid-Autumn Festival, ... we have ... can we have others ... more ...... environmentally friendly way to celebrate our Mid-Autumn Festival. Er, I think ... I think ... I think government can ... lunch ... more firework, ... firework for Hong Kong people. Because now ... firework in ... Mid-Autumn Festival, just in ... Victoria, Victoria Harbour can see. So, I think ... government can ... explode ... the firework, like to ... territory, or Kowloon. I think ... this would be a more ... environmentally friendly and ... can avoid ... mooncake ..."

Er, I think to celebrate the festival, it doesn't means to have a, to prepare a lot of luxury present and give for our friends and ... relatives.

They need to use a lot of fuels to burn it and ... during the process, it will also ... produce some further pollutions, such as air pollution.
